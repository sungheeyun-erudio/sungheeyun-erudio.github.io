# MILESTONES & TIMELINE

**Immediate (Aug-Sep 2025):**
- ✅ Erudio Bio Korea, Inc. operational with Jin Young Heo as CLO
- ✅ Jeonbuk corporate bank account opened
- ✅ USD 140k angel investment secured
- 🔄 SNUBH partnership terms finalized
- 🔄 Jeonbuk Special R&D Zone application submitted

**Short-term (Q4 2025):**

- SNUBH joint development project kickoff using residual specimens
- Government grant applications via BSR Korea (contingent on designation)

**Medium-term (2026):**

# STRATEGIC INSIGHTS

1. **Speed to Market:** Using SNUBH facilities and residual specimens eliminates 6+ months of setup time and regulatory complexity

2. **Government Support:** Jeonbuk Special R&D Zone designation unlocks significant grant funding, but requires strong commercialization narrative (not just R&D story)

3. **Partnership Model:** SNUBH's willingness to provide facilities demonstrates strong institutional commitment beyond typical collaboration

4. **Capital Efficiency:** USD 140k angel investment + potential government grants positions Korea entity for aggressive execution without heavy US dilution

5. **Organizational Structure:** Jin Young Heo as CLO/BD Manager provides critical local expertise for navigating Korean regulatory and government landscape
