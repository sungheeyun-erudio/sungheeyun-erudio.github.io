Erudio Bio, Inc. @ Silicon Valley, CA, USA & Seoul, Korea proudly announces that we have successfully completed two major joint development projects with leading Asian medical institutions.
In partnership with Shanghai Hospital Network (SHN) and Bundang Seoul National University General Hospital (SNUBH),
we have developed two breakthrough diagnostic platforms:
a comprehensive uveitis
(<a href="https://www.nei.nih.gov/learn-about-eye-health/eye-conditions-and-diseases/uveitis">National Eye Institute</a>,
<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/uveitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20378734">Mayo Clinic</a>,
<a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/14414-uveitis">Cleveland Clinic</a>)
diagnostic kit detecting 11 cytokine biomarkers in intraocular fluid,
and an innovative cancer screening platform capable of detecting 13 distinct cancer biomarkers
in patient blood.

&ldquo;These parallel breakthroughs represent Erudio Bio's commitment to advancing precision diagnostics across multiple medical fields,&rdquo;
said Kee Park, CEO of Erudio Bio.
&ldquo;Our rapid market penetration, evidenced by pre-launch contracts with 30 hospitals across Asia and the United States, validates the urgent market need for these innovative diagnostic solutions.&rdquo;

The uveitis diagnostic kit, developed with Shanghai Hospital Network, employs proprietary technology to simultaneously detect and quantify 11 distinct cytokine biomarkers from minimal intraocular fluid samples.
This breakthrough enables ophthalmologists to obtain accurate diagnostic results while dramatically reducing the required sample volume, a critical advancement in patient care.
Concurrently, our collaboration with Bundang Seoul National University Hospital has yielded a cancer screening platform that enables early detection and monitoring across 13 cancer types through a single test, representing a significant leap forward in oncology diagnostics.
These innovations not only reduce diagnostic costs significantly but also enable proactive disease detection at earlier stages,
substantially improving patient outcomes and cure rates through timely intervention.

The technical validation of both platforms has demonstrated exceptional performance across all critical parameters.
Our proprietary technology has achieved unprecedented sensitivity levels while maintaining reliability across diverse sample types.
The streamlined workflows not only preserve precious patient samples but also enable faster turnaround times, allowing healthcare providers to make more informed decisions quickly and efficiently.

Our market entry has already demonstrated remarkable momentum across multiple regions.
In South Korea, we have established strong partnerships with 23 general and medium-sized hospitals, creating a robust foundation for our domestic market presence.
This success has extended internationally, with seven major general hospitals in the United States already committed to implementing our diagnostic platforms.
These partnerships complement our established collaboration with Shanghai Hospital Network's extensive healthcare system.
Additionally, we are in advanced discussions with numerous healthcare providers across these regions, signaling strong potential for rapid market expansion.

The combined market opportunity represents over 1.2 million potential tests annually, with a projected market value exceeding $280M USD.
Initial rollout data suggests potential market penetration of 35% within the first 18 months of launch, reflecting the strong demand for advanced diagnostic solutions in both ophthalmology and oncology.

&ldquo;The overwhelming response from healthcare providers across multiple markets underscores the critical need for these advanced diagnostic solutions,&rdquo;
commented [Business Development VP Name], Vice President of Business Development at Erudio Bio. &ldquo;Our strategic partnerships now span three major healthcare markets, positioning us for rapid scaling and broader market access.&rdquo;

To meet this robust demand, Erudio Bio has established a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Songdo, South Korea.
The facility's initial annual production capacity of 300,000 test kits across both platforms demonstrates our commitment to meeting market needs.
In response to strong pre-launch interest, we have already initiated plans to double this capacity by Q4 2026.
The company has successfully secured necessary regulatory approvals from China's NMPA, Korea's MFDS, and the U.S. FDA,
enabling immediate market entry upon commercial launch in Q2 2026.
