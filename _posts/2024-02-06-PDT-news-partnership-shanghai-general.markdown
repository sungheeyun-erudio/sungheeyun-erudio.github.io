Feb 6, 2024 - Erudio Bio, Inc., a leader in multiplex bio detection, is thrilled to announce a groundbreaking research partnership with Shanghai General Hospital, one of the world's leading healthcare institutions.

This collaboration will focus on validating the use of Erudio's VSA prototype platform for multiplexed analysis of human ocular samples. The project aims to demonstrate how Erudio's technology can address the challenge of analyzing multiple biomarkers from the limited sample sizes typically available in ocular research.

"We are incredibly excited to partner with Shanghai General Hospital on this groundbreaking research initiative," said Kee-Hyun Paik, CEO and Founder of Erudio Bio. "This collaboration has the potential to significantly improve the way ocular diseases are diagnosed and treated."
