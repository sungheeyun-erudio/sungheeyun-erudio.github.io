<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>

<p>
Erudio Bio, Inc. is transforming the economics of medicine with our innovative Versatile Smart Assay (VSA),
a cutting-edge semiconductor-based multiplexed instrument platform. Our technology enables comprehensive biomarker testing from a single biological sample, facilitating precise diagnoses and reducing the risk of missed or delayed disease identification. Utilizing our patented dynamic force spectroscopy, Erudio's VSA significantly reduces false positives and achieves unparalleled accuracy by measuring the strength of biomarker-antibody binding. This empowers healthcare providers to detect diseases earlier, saving countless lives and preventing unnecessary suffering.
