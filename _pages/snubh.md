	Joint development project proposal
</h1>

Dear SNUBH,

We at Erudio Bio, Inc. are excited to propose a Joint Development Project with Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, focusing on the detection and screening of cancer biomarkers and/or antibodies necessary for vaccination.

Following our successful discussions and preliminary agreements with Shanghai Hospital, we are keen to extend our expertise in assay development to SNUBH. Our recent collaboration involved the development of assays for uveitis using a phased approach, initially focusing on a subset of targets to streamline technology transfer and expedite publication processes. We propose a similar methodology where we begin with identifying key cancer biomarkers or vaccination-related antibodies, e.g., hepatitis, allowing for an efficient development cycle and early data publication.

Key aspects of our proposal include:

- Assay Development: Utilizing our advanced reagents and established protocols, we aim to develop sensitive and specific assays. We would start with a smaller panel of biomarkers or antibodies to ensure thorough validation and optimization, similar to our approach with Shanghai Hospital. This includes the use of artificial biological matrices during initial stages to conserve precious clinical samples.
- Data Sharing and Validation: We will share historical data on assay performance in various matrices, including test range, Limit of Detection (LOD), linearity, and inhibition percentages, to facilitate a smooth transition into clinical application.
- Joint Publication: A crucial aspect of our partnership will be the preparation and submission of a joint publication detailing our findings. This publication will serve as a testament to our collaborative efforts and the advancements made in cancer biomarker detection.
- Technology Transfer: To ensure the success of our project, we plan to transfer our proprietary assay technology and reagents to SNUBH. This includes sharing the precise procedures and protocols required for optimal results.
- Intellectual Property and Commercial Rights: The terms of intellectual property rights, commercialization, and publication will be clearly outlined in the Joint Development Agreement to ensure mutual benefit and protection.
- Timeline and Milestones: We propose to set a clear timeline, with defined milestones for assay development, validation, and subsequent clinical testing phases, ensuring that all parties are aligned on project expectations and deliverables.

We believe that this collaboration will not only advance diagnostic capabilities at SNUBH but also contribute significantly to global health by enhancing early detection and management strategies for cancer and infectious diseases. 

We are eager to discuss this proposal further and explore how we can tailor our joint efforts to meet SNUBH's specific needs and research interests.

Best regards,

	Brief intro to Erudio Bio, Inc.
</h1>


[Erudio Bio, Inc.]({{ site.baseurl }}/) is revolutionizing the economics of medicine with an AI enabled platform that can generate 1000x more data from a single biological sample than the market leading technology to make an impact on the $800B personalized medicine market. We stand to rapidly build shareholder value upon 16 years of previous work. Erudioâ€™s dynamic force spectroscopy was birthed at Stanford School of Medicine and the technology was validated by Analog Devices, a $90B semi company, resulting in a partnership. Erudio began working with a large foreign hospital system serving 83M patient visits per year.

Here are a few highlights about the business:

- AI enhanced semiconductor chip-based medical data platform from Stanford
- Technology risk removed from 16 years of previous work evaluated by Analog Devices
- Product-market-fit with large foreign hospital system
