<!--Our <a href="https://www.erudio.bio/general-5">innovative patented technology</a> addresses-->
Our <a href="/blog/PDT-IP/">innovative patented technology</a> addresses
critical limitations in current multiplexed assay methods,
opening new possibilities in disease detection and drug development.

<h2 id="multiplexing">
	Revolutionary Multiplex Testing
</h2>

Our VSA technology platform enables simultaneous testing for multiple biomarkers from a single biological sample, overcoming the limitations of traditional methods. This breakthrough allows for comprehensive medical testing, early disease detection, and efficient biotech drug development.

<h2 id="force-spectroscopy">
	Comprehensive Data with Force Spectroscopy
</h2>

Our patented force spectroscopy technology measures the strength of bonds between biological molecules, filtering out false positives and ensuring accurate results. This innovative approach allows us to perform accurate multiplexed assays despite the difficulties of cross-reactivity and non-specific bindings

<h2 id="data-collection">
	Enhanced Data Collection for AI and Machine Learning
</h2>

With our expanding partnerships, Erudio is poised to generate vast amounts of medical data, driving knowledge discovery through   hidden insights and patterns from this extensive biological data.
